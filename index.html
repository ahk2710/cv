        <h1>Ali Khan</h1>
        <p><em>That is <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alihkhan/">me!</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a seasoned professional with 3+ years of business development and customer service experience in diverse sectors. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for sales management, as well as for team building and information
          systems, I
          have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career. As such, I have consistently exceeded business and performance goals, and I am adept at achieving maximum revenue impact with minimal
          resource expenditure. Professional focal points include operations management, programming languages, lead generation, solution selling, strategic planning, decision making, and data analysis. Delivering superior administration on the
          latter
          areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication and prioritization skills, as well as critical thinking, process enhancement, project management, and critical thinking to support efficiency and maximum returns.

          Currently, I am the Business Development Representative with Carahsoft Technology Corporation. Under my leadership, I conceptualize, design, and execute prospecting campaigns with the goal of identifying and securing key clients in IT
          security. I
          consistently ascertain new sales opportunities, achieve company and personal goals, and develop account growth strategies alongside internal partners. In addition, I liaise with senior leadership, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams to
          ensure the company‚Äôs development support structure is driving the business forward with minimal expenditures.

          Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, business and managerial expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver profitable results on time and under budget.

          I am interested in contacting former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my field. Feel free to contact me through this profile if you wish to connect.</p>
